# HOSTING

## How to allow others to join your SPT-Aki Server?

## How to join each other's match
THIS IS EXTREMELY EXPERIMENTAL AT THIS TIME AND LIKELY TO CHANGE

### HOST
1) The HOST must select a Map, Time and Offline Settings - It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you test on FACTORY first
2) The HOST should see "HOST RAID" instead of "READY" on the last screen
3) The HOST clicks "HOST RAID"
4) The HOST chooses how many players and start it. It will wait for another player when done loading.

## CLIENT
1) The CLIENT must wait until the HOST has loaded the match.
2) The CLIENT must select the same Map & Time
3) The CLIENT clicks "JOIN GAME" on host's raid

## NOTES / ISSUES
- Both HOST and CLIENT should spawn on each others game after a few seconds
- CLIENT may not see BOTS until they are spawned in their RAID and may be targeted by BOTS on the HOST before CLIENT spawns them
- If the HOST has opened a door before a CLIENT has joined, the CLIENT may not see some doors opened
- Only ONE match can run on a Server at ONE time, this means if the HOST or CLIENT dies, they must wait for the game to FINISH before playing again.
- If the HOST dies, he must wait for every player to die/extract and then press F8. Doing it before the requirements will extract everyone from the raid.
